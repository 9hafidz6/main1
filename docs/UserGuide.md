## 3. Features

**Command Format**

- Command parameter in `UPPER_CASE` is needed to be specified by the user. E.g., `add DESC` can be specified as `add noodle`.
- Command parameter followed by `-(...)` is to inform the user of the specifying format. E.g., `ORDER_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)` indicates only the format such as `31/12/2019` is accepted. 
- Some command parameter is followed by `-(option: a (default) | b | c)`, indicating it has `a`, `b`, `c` three options, with the default set to `a`. E.g., for `-l LIST_TYPE-(option: all (default) | undone)`, the user can enter `-l` without further specification as it is equivalent to `-l all`, or specify as `-l undone`.
- Command parameter can be optional. If it is wrapped by `[...]`, the specification can be dropped and the value is set as `NULL` or default. Otherwise, the parameter must be specified. E.g.,  `add [-d ORDER_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)] -n DISH1_NAME[*DISH_AMOUNT], DISH2_NAME[*DISH_AMOUNT]` supports command  `add chicken rice*1, cake*2, laksa`, where the order date is set to `date of today` if not specified, and the dish amount is set to `1` if not specified.

### 3.3 Ingredient Management by Fridge Storage

To begin with, the user needs to enter command `'a'- remove all expired` or `'b' - add/remove/use an ingredient` in the main menu. In mode `a`, all expired ingredients would be removed after execution of the command `a`. While the execution of command  `b`, redirects the user into Ingredients management menu. The below commands, except for removing all expired, are all executed in the Ingredient management menu, upon choosing option `b`.

#### 3.3.1 Adding Ingredient

To add an ingredient to the `Fridge`, the user needs to execute command below:

Format: `add `  `INGREDIENT_NAME` `INGREDIENT_AMOUNT` `INGREDIENT_EXPIRY_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)`

If the ingredient already exist in the `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`, but **does not have the same expiry date as the ingredient to be added**, another entry of the ingredient will be created in the ingredient list, differing from the existing one by the expiry date. **However**, if the ingredient to be added also **has the same expiry date as an existing ingredient in the ingredient list with the same name**, the amount of the ingredient to be added will be added onto the amount of the existing ingredient and no new entry will be created in the `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`.

Examples: 

- `add ` `chicken` `3  ` `1/2/2020`
- `add` `chilli` `70` `29/04/2019`  

```
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
add chicken 3 1/2/2020
     Got it. I've added chicken to the fridge, you currently have:
	 chicken, amount is: 3 expiring on 1st of February 2020
	 
add chicken 2 1/2/2020

	Got it. I've added chicken to the fridge, you currently have:
	chicken, amount is: 5 expiring on 1st of February 2020
	
add chicken 4 2/3/2020

	Got it. I've added chicken to the fridge, you currently have:
	chicken, amount is: 4 expiring on 2nd of March 2020
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
```

Furthermore, if the user adds an expired ingredient, he gets a `WARNING!!! Adding an expired ingredient in the fridge, do you want to proceed adding it? ` 

```
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
add milk 250 9/11/2019

 	WARNING!!! Adding an expired ingredient in the fridge, do you want to proceed adding     it? 
    Type yes to confirm, typing anything else will result in not adding the ingredient
    
yes
		Got it. I've added milk to the fridge, you currently have:
		WARNING! expired ingredient: milk, amount is: 250 expired on 9th of November 2019
	 _________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 3.3.2 Removing Ingredient

To remove an ingredient from the `Fridge`, user needs to execute command below:

Format: `remove ` `ingredient index`

If the ingredient index does not exist in the list, the following message is printed :

```
	 ☹ OOPS!!! Enter a valid ingredient index number after delete, between 1 and 14.
	 You can type: 
	'template' to see the format of the commands, 
	'back' to see all your options, 
	'q' to exit
```

This example was done when the size of the ingredient list is 14.

Examples: 

- `remove ` `7`
- `remove` `3 `

```
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
     Noted. I've removed this ingredient:
	 salt, amount is: 50 expiring on 31st of October 2019
	 Now you have 14 ingredients in the list.
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 3.3.3 Finding Ingredient

To find an ingredient from the `Fridge`, user needs to execute command below:

Format: `find` `INGREDIENT_NAME`

If the ingredient index does not exist in the list, message is output:

```
	 No such ingredient found!
```

Examples: 

- `find ` `salt`
- `find` ` chilli `

```
These are the ingredients you searched for!
	 5. salt 50 31/10/2019.
	 9. salt 60 21/07/2021
```


#### 3.3.4 Using an ingredient 

To use an ingredient from the `Fridge`, the user needs to execute the command below:

Format: `use`  `INGREDIENT_NAME` `INGREDIENT_AMOUNT` 

A warning:  `*always use most recently expiring ingredients first, to prevent food waste!*` is printed when showing the example use of this command. This notifies the chef that he should be using the ingredients with the most recent expiry date first. This command will look through all the ingredients matching the ingredient name, sorted by ascending expiry date, and continue removing them (considering the amount of the ingredient they contain ) until the total  `INGREDIENT_AMOUNT` is used/reached. Furthermore, if the `Fridge` contains expired ingredients matching the  `INGREDIENT_NAME`, they are not taken into consideration, since the Chef should not be able to use an expired ingredient in his dishes!

If there are not enough required ingredients, the following message is printed:

```
	 There is not a sufficient amount of rice that is not expired, maybe you could buy some first? 
```

Examples: 

- `use ` `salt` `50` 
- `use` ` chilli` `40`  

```
	 Great you used salt amount: 50
```

Also, once amount reaches 0, the ingredient will be deleted off from the `IngredientsList` of the `Fridge` .

#### 3.3.5 Listing all expired ingredients on the date itself

To list all expired ingredient from the IngredientsList on the date itself, user needs to execute command below:

Format: `listtoday`

if there are no expired ingredients for the date itself, message is output:

```
	 No expired ingredients for today!
```

Otherwise,

```
	 Here are the expired ingredients for today
	 6. salt, amount is: 50 expired on 31st of October 2019.
	 7. chilli, amount is: 60 expired on 31st of October 2019.
```

#### 3.3.6 Removing all expired ingredients 

To be able to use this feature, the user needs to enter `a` in the menu, and it will remove all of the expired ingredients currently in the `Fridge`.

*Note that*: removing all expired command is executed by the user entering `a` in the **main menu**.

If there are no expired ingredients in the `Fridge`, the user gets the following output upon trying to use this feature.

```
	 ☹ OOPS!!! Seems like you don't have any expired ingredients in the fridge!
```

Otherwise,

```
	Removed ingredients: 
salt, amount is: 50, expired on 31st of October 2019
milk, amount is: 150, expired on 11th of October 2019
```

### 3.5 Order Management

To begin with, the user needs to enter command `c` in main menu, so as to step into Order management menu. The below commands are all executed in the Order management menu. 

#### 3.5.1 Adding Order Today or Pre-Order

To add a new order to the order list, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format: `add [-d ORDER_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)] -n DISH1_NAME[*DISH1_AMOUNT], DISH2_NAME[*DISH2_AMOUNT], ...`

<u>Requirement:</u>

- The serving date of the order `ORDER_DATE` should be valid and **cannot be before today**. 
  - If the date is today, the user can simply enter command `add -n DISH_NAME[*DISH_AMOUNT], ...`. 
  - Otherwise, the order is treated as *pre-order*. `ORDER_DATE` must be specified.
- The ordered dishes **cannot be empty**.

Examples: 

- `add -d 31/12/2019 -n beef noodle*3`: there can be only one ordered dishes.
- `add -d 12/11/2019 -n chicken rice*1, cake*2, laksa`: the amount of laksa is 1, as default.
- `add -n pasta, mushroom soup` : the serving date of this order is date of today, as default.

Sample output message:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Got it. I've added this order: 
	 [✘] Order on 31/12/2019 
	    (1) beef noodle 3
	 Now you have 1 orders in the order list.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Got it. I've added this order: 
	 [✘] Order today 
	    (1) pasta 1
	    (2) mushroom soup 1
	 Now you have 2 orders in the order list.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 3.5.2 Altering Order Serving Date

In pre-order management, it is very likely that the serving date alters. To update the serving date information of an order in the order list, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format: `alter ORDER_INDEX ORDER_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)`

<u>Requirement:</u>

- Altering a done order is not expected. It will do nothing and reminds you of  `Order done already. Date alteration is not expected.`
- The range of `ORDER_INDEX` is 1 to the size of the order list.
- The newly set date should be in valid format and **cannot be before today**. 
  - If the date is today, the user can simply enter `alter ORDER_INDEX`. 
  - Otherwise, the order is treated as *pre-order*. `ORDER_DATE` must be specified.

Examples: 

- `alter 2`: changes the serving date of 2nd order in the order list to today.
- `alter 1 03/01/2020`: changes the serving date of 2nd order in the order list to `03/01/2020`.

If the order list is empty, the output message would be:

```
	 OOPS!!! No order in the list! No order can be altered!
```

Otherwise, the sample output message would be like:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Nice! I've changed the order to the date 07/11/2019:
	 [✘] Order today 
	    (1) fish 1
	    (2) chili crab 1
	    (3) rice 2
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Nice! I've changed the order to the date 03/12/2019:
	 [✘] Order /on 03/12/2019 
	    (1) fish 1
	    (2) chili crab 1
	    (3) rice 2
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```



#### 3.5.3 Cancelling Order

To cancel an existing order from the order list, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format: `cancel ORDER_INDEX`

<u>Requirement:</u>

- The range of `ORDER_INDEX` ranges from 1 to the size of the order list. Use command `list` to check `ORDER_INDEX`.
- Only **today's undone order** or **pre-order** can be cancelled. 

Examples: 

- `cancel 3`: remove 3rd order in the order list, if exists.

If the order list is empty, the output message would be:

```
	 OOPS!!! No order in the list! No order can be removed!
```

Otherwise, the sample output message would be like:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Noted. I've cancelled this order:
	 [✘] Order /on 03/12/2019 
	    (1) fish 1
	    (2) chili crab 1
	    (3) rice 2
	 Now you have 3 orders in the order list.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```



#### 3.5.4 Marking Order as Done

To mark an existing undone order of the date today as done, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format: `done ORDER_INDEX`

<u>Requirement:</u>

- `ORDER_INDEX` ranges from 1 to the size of the (whole) order list. Use command `list` to check `ORDER_INDEX`.
- Only **today's undone order** can be done. Pre-order supports cancellation and date alteration.

Examples: 

- `done 2`: Mark 2nd order in the order list as done, if there exists. 

If the order list is empty, the output message would be:

```
	 OOPS!!! No order in the list! No order can be done!
```

Otherwise, the sample output message would be like:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 Nice! I've marked this order as done:
	 [✓] Order /on 12/09/2020 
	    (1) beef noodle 1
	    (2) chili crab 1
	    (3) rice 3
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```



#### 3.5.5 Initializing Order List

To clear all the orders in the order list, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format: `init`

The program will then asks the user to confirm the initialization: `Are you sure you want to clear all orders in the order list? [y/n] `

If the user answers  `y` or `Y`, the output message will be:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 ORDER LIST CLEARED
	 TODAY TODO LIST CLEARED

	 Continue by adding order. Template:
	 add [-d ORDER_DATE-(dd/mm/yyyy)] -n DISH1_NAME[*DISH_AMOUNT], DISH2_NAME[*DISH_AMOUNT]
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```

If the user answers  `n`  or `N`, the output message will be:

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
	 ORDER LIST NOT CLEARED

	 Continue by adding, removing, altering, listing order.
	 Type 'template' to see the format of the commands
_________________________________________________________________________________________
```

If the user enters neither `y` or `n`, then the order list maintains. Note that the user has to enter `init` again and then enters confirm the initialization. An `y` or `n`  command not after the confirmation question is regarded as invalid. The reminding message will be:

```
	 OOPS!!! Please enter 'y' or 'n' after the second 'init' command.
```



#### 3.5.6 Listing Order by Different Filtering Keywords

To list orders in the order list, the user needs to execute the command following the below format.

Format 1: `list [-l LIST_TYPE-(option: all (default) | undone | today | undoneToday)]`
